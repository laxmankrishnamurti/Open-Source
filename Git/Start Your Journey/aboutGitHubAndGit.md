# About GitHub and Git

We can use both GitHub and Git to collaborate on work.

## About GitHub

- GitHub is a cloud-based platform where we can:
  - store
  - share
  - and work together with others to write code.

At its core, GitHub is built upon Git. One of the fundamental feature of GitHub is _collaborative working._

## About Git

Git is a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files.

If we are working in a team, Git facilitates many features such as:

- Create multiple branches by copying the main file content which is in the main branch.
- Make changes independently in the branch that will not going to affect any other branches except the branch in which we've made changes.
- Whenever a branch(typically referes to a featue, bugs, ..etc) is ready for production we merge it with the main branch and make it available to the world.

Git keeps tracking other member changes, to ensure all have up-to-dated version of code.

## How do Git and GitHub work together?

- Technically, GitHub is just like a storage location.
- Whenever we make a new respository on GitHub technically we are creating a Git repository in which Git intelligently track all changes that we made in the file.
- Generally, we work on our files locally(on our own computers)
- We pull latest changes from the same repositroy
- After making changes in the file we push back our changes to the same repository using "pull request".

## Where should i start?

- Create an account on GitHub
- Learn the basic terminologies of GitHub(like branches, commits, pull requests, etc.)
- Personalize your profile
- Play with GitHub
- Install Git on your local system.
